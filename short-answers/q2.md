# Question

What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

When data is passed by value, the value itself is copied. There will then be two pieces of data with the same value in the computer's memory. Primitive data types are non-mutable for this reason; every change/reassignment you try to make is actually a new piece of data.

When data is passed by reference, the pointer to the data is copied. Since many variables can point to that same data, when a change is made with one reference, it will be reflected in all other references (unless a new copy is explicitly made of the data). Reference data types are mutable for this reason; the changes in the data are directed to the data, not automatically copied.
