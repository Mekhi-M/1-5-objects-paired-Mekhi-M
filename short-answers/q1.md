# Question

When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer

When you want to list similar values you would want to use an array. For example, if you wanted to list the letters of the alphabet, you would use an array because they all fit into the category of "letters of the alphabet".

When you want to list out the different attributes of a thing, you would want to use an object. For example, if you wanted to represent a car you would want to include things like a color, or a brand, name or a number of miles. These pieces aren't normally related except through the context of being for a car, so placing them all inside of a car object would be appropriate.
