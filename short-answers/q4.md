# Question

Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer

It is not valid JSON because the keys "name", "isCool", and "age" are not wrapped in double quotes.
