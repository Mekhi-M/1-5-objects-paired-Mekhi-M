# Question

What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer

Shallow clones are copies of the data of an object at a different place in storage. The issue with this is that passing by reference and value applies to everything inside the object. The primitive data types will be copied as intended, but nested reference data types will copy the pointer to the actual data. Any changes you try to make to objects/arrays inside a shallow clone will be reflected in the original copy.
